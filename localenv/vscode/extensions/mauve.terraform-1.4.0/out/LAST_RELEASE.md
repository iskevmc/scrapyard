# 1.4.0

Thanks to [@lawrencegripper](https://github.com/lawrencegripper) and [@juliosueiras](https://github.com/juliosueiras) we now have the first release in place which supports Terraform 0.12 using a new and shiny language server. In order to start using the language server you need to change the configuration to enable it or run the command `Terraform: Enable/Disable Language Server` or set `terraform.languageServer.enabled` to `true`.

## New Features

- Terraform 0.12 support 🎉🎆🎉
