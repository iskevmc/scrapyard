## Prerequisites

|platform|prerequisite|
|--------|-----------|
|Run Playbook in Cloud Shell/Remotely via ssh| nodejs >= 6.0 |
|Run Playbook in Docker|Docker|
|Run Playbook in Local Ansible| Ansible |

## Usage
Associate your Yaml files with `ansible` language in VSCode `settings.json`:
```
   "files.associations": {
        "**/*.yml": "ansible"
    },
```

### Code snippets  
Code snippets will be in auto-completed list with suffix `_snippet`. Press `tab` to move inside snippet parameters.

### Syntax highlighting
Enable syntax highlighting by adding `files.associations` in `settings.json`, to associate your paths with `ansible` language, please see [sample](#usage).


### Run Ansible playbook   
![run playbook](https://github.com/VSChina/vscode-ansible/raw/master/./images/menu.png)
  
#### Run Playbook in Docker
1. Make sure Docker is installed and running. For non-Windows platform, please configure Docker run without sudo.
1. Default docker image is [microsoft/ansible:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/ansible/tags/), which is latest Ansible version. Customizing your own docker image by configuration item `ansible.dockerImage`, customizing docker init command by configuration `ansible.termininalInitCommand`, eg. `docker run -i -t microsoft/ansible:ansible2.5.5 /bin/bash`. Detail please see [configuration](#configuration).
1. For Windows user, please share your Windows driver where vscode workspace sits on with docker. This is because the extension will map your workspace containing playbook with docker.   
![docker share driver](https://github.com/VSChina/vscode-ansible/raw/master/./images/dockerconfig.png)
1. This step is optional. If you want to run cloud provider specific Ansible modules, you need set cloud credentials in credential yaml file, default path is `$HOME/.vscode/ansible-credentials.yml`, or change credential file path by settings item  `ansible.credentialsFile`. Credential file template is at [here](https://github.com/VSChina/vscode-ansible/blob/master/config/credentials.yml).

#### Run Playbook in Local Ansible
1. Make sure Ansible is installed.
1. This step is optional. If you want to run cloud provider specific Ansible modules, please setup cloud credentials by following [Ansible instruction](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/guides.html). Or you can set cloud credentials in credential file, default path is `$HOME/.vscode/ansible-credentials.yml`, change credential file path by settings item  `ansible.credentialsFile`.

Please retry open cloud shell.
    
#### Run Playbook Remotely via ssh
1. Press `F1`, choose `Run Ansible Playbook Remotely via ssh`, follow wizard to pick up/add remote host. Or configure your remote server in `$HOME/.ssh/servers.json` like below.
   ```
   [
        {

        }
   ]
   ```

#### Files copy to remote on saving
1. Configure file copying to remote host on saving as below in `settings.json`. `sourcePath` will be copied to remote `server` as `targetPath` when configuration added/updated. `copyOnSave` will copy local saved files to remote host.
```
    "ansible.fileCopyConfig": 
        {
            "server": "remote-host-name",
            "sourcePath": "local file/folder to copy from, eg. e:\\testfolder\\ansibleplaybooks",
            "targetPath": "remote file/folder to copy to, eg. /home/user/ansibleplaybooks",
            "copyOnSave": true // When true, files saved inside VSCode will be copied automatically to remote host.
        }
    ]
```
There's notification message at right side of status bar.

## Samples for azure_rm_resource (Preview)

This command provides sample code snippets for [azure_rm_resource](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/azure_rm_resource_module.html) module, those samples are from [Azure Rest API spec](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs.git).

To use, press **F1** and then select **Ansible: Samples for azure_rm_resource (PREVIEW)** command.
You will be first asked for API group, then required operation. After selecting operation a pickup list will be displayed where you can select particular API version and sample. Extension will create appropriate playbook based on **azure_rm_resource** or **azure_rm_resource_facts** module.

Note that all the samples generated by the extension are based on REST API samples from this repository:

https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs

Please also refer to Azure REST API reference here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/?view=Azure

In case of any bugs encountered in samples please fill an issue here:

https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/issues

**Note 1**: This feature requires Ansible >= 2.7.

**Note 2**: When using for the first time it may take a few minutes to retrieve REST API specifications.
