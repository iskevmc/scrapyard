### Show named profile mapped to default
![Show Mapped Profile](https://github.com/rmtuckerphx/aws-cli-configure/raw/master/images/statusbar-mapped-profile.png)

- Saving the 'credentials' file from VSCode or setting the default profile updates the status bar. 
- Click the item in the status bar to set the [default] profile to a [named] profile.


### Set default profile
![Set Default Profile](https://github.com/rmtuckerphx/aws-cli-configure/raw/master/images/set-default-profile.png)
To be able to set the [default] profile to a named profile, in the 'credentials' file each profile section must contain only two entries following one of these formats:

- aws_access_key_id & aws_secret_access_key
- role_arn & source_profile

This sample shows the `master-profile` in one account that uses an access key and secret and three role profiles each in a seperate account that references the `master-profile` as the source profile.

The [default] profile is set to `qa-profile`.

Put `region` and other entries in the `config` file.
If a section in `credentials` includes more than the required two entries and you try to set the default profile to it, you will get the following error:

![Invalid schema error](https://github.com/rmtuckerphx/aws-cli-configure/raw/master/images/invalid-schema-error.png)
